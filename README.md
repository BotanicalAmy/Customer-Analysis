# Customer_Analysis
This customer analysis was created from a fictitious food supplier and was analyzed as part of a machine learning and AI course.  The assignment included data preparation and visualization techniques.

**Data Preparation Techniques:**
*Grouping ages in bins of ten years, adding the age category as a new column
*Removal of income outliers
*Grouping and querying techniques for data analysis and visuals

**Visualization Techniques:**
*Correlation matrix to get an overview of the data
*Histogram showing the distribution of customers by birth year
*Visualization of average spending by web count visit
*Scatterplot of spending by income and family size
*Percentage of spending by purchase type (catalog, web and store)

The analysis and visualizations were used to determine customer demographics and spending trends.
